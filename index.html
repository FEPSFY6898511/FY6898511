        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>Graphene is an awesome material that increases the capacity, thermals, lifespan and efficiency of a battery. Having only been synthesised recently, this carbon substance brings promises of revolution to technology, such as increases in battery capacity, thermals, lifespan and efficiency. In the near future, this material could become as abundant as plastic. This study presents research and finding from esteemed sources to confirm these ideas and by the end, you will have a strong understanding of how this substance intertwines with your device and your future.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The future of batteries begins now! Graphene is a substance with incredible properties, which this article hopes to bring light to, along with the ways they are going to affect you. Yes, YOU! I aim to demonstrate to you all the benefits that come aboutwith this revolution, bringing in professionally tested examples and linking how its functions link to the industries requirements. Furthermore, I will describe the history and future of graphene's role in batteries. By the end of this article, you should have a strong understanding of graphene's purpose in batteries, the science behind it and what you can do to reap the benefits of this generous material.</p>

    <section id="graphene-history">
        <h3>Graphene and its history:</h3>
        <p>Graphene is made of carbon, and is extracted from graphite. It was first theorised in 1947 and was first discovered through isolation in 2003 at the University of Manchester, by Kostya Novoselov and Andre Geim (Science and industry museum, 2021). A sheet of graphene is the thinnest material possible, with it being only 1 atom thick, yet over 200x stronger than steel. This gives it uses in departments of military, health, transport and more (University of Manchester, No date). It's thinness makes it quite floppy, and while it can be used on a substrate (Clegg, 2018, pg 79) (a material that adds structural support, yet doesn't interfere properties-wise), it could also be shaped and moulded into specific objects. Nifty!</p>

    <section id="why-familiar">
        <h3>Why does the word graphene sound familiar?:</h3>
        <p>Because you've likely heard of its big brother graphite, used to make pencils. Graphite is made up of hundreds of thousands of layers of graphene (Zurutuza, No date). This is why graphene was discovered, not invented, as graphite is a naturally occurring mineral, therefore making graphene also naturally occurring.</p>

    <section id="battery-effects">
        <h3>How does graphene affect batteries?:</h3>
        <p>Today, the battery is our mobile devices' most valuable resource, with all components having to fight over the little amount given to your electronics. So a substance that improves your devices battery entirely affects the device and how you use it. Graphene is one of these substances. It is highly conductive, which makes it an excellent candidate in improving battery performance (as battery performance is proportional to conductivity of its makeup). Graphene is lighter than lithium (JamesHartChorley, 2021), on average 30% (Rupareliya, 2023), so implementations bring weight reductions to the batteries and the portable devices they sit in. This translates to real world benefits: Productivity would increase on laptops whose powercells didn’t depend on your proximity to an outlet. Long haul flights would be less mentally taxing if you knew that your mobile would last you through the journey. It might sound obvious but it pays off to have a better battery, especially when its longevity makes it an afterthought when using it. </p>

    <section id="adding-graphene">
        <h3>How to add graphene to batteries:</h3>
        <p>Graphene can be added to a battery in many ways. These include being: </p>
	<p>	  • Mixed with lithium to create graphene enhanced Li-Ion batteries</p>
	<p>	  • Fixed to the conductive end of traditional Li-Ion cells to increase conductivity</p>
	<p>	  • Separately refined into solid state batteries</p>
        <p>	  • Installed around the outside of a battery to act as a heatsink </p>
    </section>
	
    <section id="use-cases">
        <h3>The use cases:</h3>
        <p>The 3 major battery benefits bestowed by graphene are:</p>
	<p>	  • Charging speed increases - The very high electrical conductivity of graphene boosts the density of the electrode within the battery, enabling greater power transfer and faster charging speeds with reduced heat (Dam, 2022)</p>
	<p>	  • Thermal pad and absorption of dissipated heat - Graphene helps spreading heat across a heatsink at rapid speeds, diminishing effects of battery expansion (ScienceDirect, 2024)</p>
        <p>	  • Battery longevity - Graphene batteries have been reported to last about 5 times longer than traditional Lithium-ion batteries (Baker, No date)</p>

    <section id="future">
        <h3>In the future:</h3>
        <p>Graphene batteries currently suffer from a lower charge capacity when compared to Li-Ion batteries, while being costly. This is why they haven't hit mass production in companies like Tesla, whose electric cars are infamous for having slow charging speeds with low mileage (Sirull, 2024). Future tech devices that rely might see a reduction in thickness, especially when considering the benefits compound effects. The media presents graphene as having no drawbacks. This is misleading; graphene is today what plastic was, when it was first synthesised. Plastic was originally considered a wonder material without any compromises, which today we know is not true, proven by the existence of plastic pollution. (Clegg, 2018)</p>

        <h3>Conclusion and my passion:</h3>
        <p>In a world where technological development from big companies, an example being Apple (Duffy 2024), seems to have halted, it is always an amazing sight to see the next big thing unravel in front of our very own eyes. I hope this article helps inspire you to find great ideas to help push our society forward. </p>
